# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\



You may also see any lint errors in the console.


First, we set up a React App with typescript and Created a new React app using Create React App with your Appname on own. 

Now we have to install dependencies according to projects for example: use Axios to make HTTP request Install axios with commands using npm Use Axios or fetch API to make the request from the provided rest API Render articles to display fetched articles we get on the front page we also use JSX to dynamically render the list of articles. 

Each article contains relevant information like a title, summary, and a link button to view the full text. Allow users to click on individual articles to view their full text. 

This content or information we get by implementing routing with React Router or by managing the applications to display the full text of the selected article. 

we can handle Errors by implementing error handling for cases such as failed data fetching or rendering issues. Display an error message when the error occurs and we retry the failed operations or navigate back to a functional state. 

Apply CSS or styling library-styled styled-components to make our app visually appealing. the layout is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
